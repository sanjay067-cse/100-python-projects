# Project 19 : Turtle Race Game 🐢

This is a fun **Turtle Race Game** built using Python’s `turtle` graphics module.  
Players can bet on which colored turtle will win the race and then watch the race unfold!

## 🎯 Project Goal  
The goal of this project is to practice **Python OOP concepts, loops, user interaction, and randomization** using the `turtle` module while creating a simple yet entertaining game.

## 🚀 How the Game Works  
1. The game window opens with **6 turtles** lined up at the starting position.  
2. The player is prompted to **place a bet** by choosing a turtle’s color:  
   - `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, or `purple`.  
3. Once the bet is placed, the race starts!  
4. Each turtle moves forward by a **random distance** on each turn.  
5. The first turtle to cross the finish line is declared the winner.  
6. The result is printed in the console:  
   - If the winning turtle matches the player’s bet → 🎉 *You win!*  
   - Otherwise → ❌ *You lose!*
