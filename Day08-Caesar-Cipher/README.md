# Project 08 : Caesar Cipher

üî∏A Caesar Cipher program is a simple Encryption and Decryption tool that shifts letters in a message by a fixed number of positions, known as the key or shift value.
<br>
üî∏This program allows users to encrypt (encode) or decrypt (decode) texts using this shifting method. 
<br>
<br>
How it works:
<br>
1Ô∏è‚É£Encryption: Each letter in the text given by the user is replaced by the letter that is 'key' number of positions down the alphabet. For example, a shift of 3 (key= 3) would turn 'A' into 'D', 'B' into 'E', and so on.
<br>
2Ô∏è‚É£Decryption: The decryption process reverses the encryption. You shift the letters back by the same key value to retrieve the original text.
<br>

Example: If the key is 3, the word "HELLO" would be encrypted to "KHOOR". and "KHOOR" will be decrypted to "HELLO" using key 3.
