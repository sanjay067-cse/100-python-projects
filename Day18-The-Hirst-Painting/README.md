# Project 18 : The Hirst Painting üé®  

This project recreates **Damien Hirst's famous spot paintings** using Python's **turtle module**.  

The program lets you:  
- Generate a colorful grid of dots  
- Randomly assign colors to each dot from a custom palette  
- Adjust spacing and number of dots  
- Watch a digital Hirst-style painting come to life  

Example:  

A 10x10 grid of colorful dots, each randomly colored from a palette of 27 shades.

## üéØ Project Goal  
The purpose of this project is to practice **Python programming and turtle graphics** while creating art programmatically. It demonstrates how loops, functions, and color manipulation can be used to recreate iconic artwork.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  
1. The **turtle module** is used to draw dots on the screen.  
2. A custom **color palette** defines the possible colors for each dot.  
3. The turtle moves to the starting position and draws a **10x10 grid** of dots.  
4. Each dot is randomly colored, and spacing is handled automatically to form a neat grid.  
5. The program waits for a click to close the window.

## üìÇ Project Structure  
- `main.py` ‚Üí Main Python file containing all the code

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example Output  

A colorful grid appears on the screen, similar to Damien Hirst's spot paintings:  

- 100 dots arranged in a 10x10 grid  
- Colors are randomly chosen from a palette of 27 colors  

Click anywhere on the screen to exit after the painting is complete.
