# Project 21 : Snake Game 🐍 

A classic Snake Game built using Python's `turtle` graphics library.  
The player controls the snake to eat food, grow longer, and score points — but beware of the walls and your own tail!

## 🎮 Features
- Smooth snake movement using arrow keys (`↑ ↓ ← →`).
- Food spawns at random positions.
- Score tracking and display.
- Game Over screen when snake hits wall or collides with itself.
- Simple and fun implementation of the classic Snake Game.
