# Day 13 - Debugging  

Today’s focus was all about something every developer faces — **Debugging** 🐞  

---

### Here’s what I learned:
- 🔹 How to carefully describe the problem before fixing it  
- 🔹 Steps to reproduce a bug consistently  
- 🔹 Walking through the code and evaluating it line by line  
- 🔹 Spotting and fixing errors by watching for underlines and compiler hints  
- 🔹 Using `print()` statements to trace issues  
- 🔹 Bringing out the Debugger (the big gun 🔫) for deeper inspection

### 💻 Coding Exercises completed:
- ✅ Debugging Odd or Even  
- ✅ Debugging Leap Year  
- ✅ Debugging FizzBuzz

✨ Every bug fixed is a step closer to writing cleaner, smarter code.  
Debugging isn’t just about fixing problems — it’s about understanding how code really works.
