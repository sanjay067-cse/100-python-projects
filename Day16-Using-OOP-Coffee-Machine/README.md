# Project 16 : Coffee Machine with OOP â˜•

An **Object-Oriented Python** program that simulates a coffee machine. This version improves upon Day 15 by organizing the code into **classes and objects** for better structure, readability, and scalability.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Order drinks: `espresso`, `latte`, `cappuccino`

- Deducts resources and serves coffee with a confirmation message
- **Uses OOP principles**: Classes for `Menu`, `CoffeeMaker`, `MoneyMachine`
