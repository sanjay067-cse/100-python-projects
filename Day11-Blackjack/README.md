# Project 11 : The Blackjack Capstone Project
## ðŸŽ¯ Objective: 
The objective of this project is to create a simple Blackjack game in Python where the player competes against the dealer.  
The goal is to get as close to **21** as possible without going over.

## ðŸ“Œ Rules:
- Number cards are worth their face value.  
- Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth **10**.  
- Aces can be worth **1** or **11**.  
- Each player starts with two cards.  
- You can:  
  - **Hit** â†’ Take another card.  
  - **Stand** â†’ Keep your total and end your turn.  
- The dealer must draw until they reach **17** or higher.  
- If you go over **21**, you lose (bust).
