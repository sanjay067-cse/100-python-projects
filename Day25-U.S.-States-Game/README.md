# Project 25 : U.S. States Game 🗺️

A fun and interactive Python game to learn the names and locations of all 50 U.S. states using **Turtle Graphics** 🐢 and **Pandas** 🐼.

---

## 📖 Overview
This game displays a blank map of the United States and asks the player to guess the names of all 50 states. ✅ Correct guesses are displayed on the map at their respective locations.  
If the player wants to quit early, the game generates a CSV file containing the states they missed for further learning 📄.

**⚠️ Note:** Make sure to run `main.py` from the **current folder** where `50_states.csv` and `blank_states_img.gif` are located. Being in the correct folder ensures the game runs without errors.
