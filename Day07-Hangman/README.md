# Project 07: Hangman 

ğŸ”¸The Hangman game is a word-guessing game where a player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters.
<br>
ğŸ”¸The game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses, and a visual representation of a "hangman" is built up with each wrong guess.
<br>
ğŸ”¸The player wins if they guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn, otherwise they lose.
